```
or execte unit tests directly:
```
> ./testAll
```

To run application execute (from build folder):

> cmake ..
> cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Debug
```
Alternatively, the last step can be performed with Visual Studio. Solution file (.sln) is generated by "cmake .." command.

To run tests execute (from build folder):
```
> ctest -C Debug
